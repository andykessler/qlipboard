# qlipboard

Instead of copy pasting a single snippet at a time, what if you could chain copy then chain paste snippets like a stack or queue? By running `qlipboard` in the background now you can!

## Notes

Just experimenting with a feature I sometimes wish existed. Imagine filling out form data field by field (say while pulling info from a spreadsheet).

This is still in proof of concept stages while I work out some quirks with this current implementation. Unsure if I'll have to get lower to the system level.

Use this at your own risk; not my fault if you thought it copied something and then it disappears forever.
